An improved database layer for WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin adds an improved database layer to WordPress. It allows you to do more then the default one and is always up-to-date with the changes core makes.

**mysql_* functions**

The mysql_* functions are officially deprecated for PHP 5.5 and are throwing E_DEPRECATED errors.
On http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663 there is discussion on this topic.

This plugin reflects those discussions.

**Why should I use this plugin?**

You should use this plugin if you want to start using PDO / MySQLi for WordPress.

== Installation ==

1. Verify that you have PDO or MySQLi
2. Go to the settings page to install db.php or copy `wp-content/db.php` to your WordPress content directory (`wp-content/` by default.
3. Done!

== Screenshots ==

1. The main settings page reports on what database drivers your PHP installation supports and lets you enable or disable the custom db.php drop-in for this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Help, I've broken my site!**

You can visit <http://yoursite.com/?wp-db-driver-emergency-override=1> (replace yoursite.com with your real WordPress blog address) to temporarily disable this plugin.
Then you can login to your admin to deactivate the plugin and restore your site's functionality.

If you need to uninstall manually, you should remove the plugin folder as well as `wp-content/db.php`.

**In what order are the drivers picked?**

PDO > MySQLi > MySQL

**How do I specify a driver?**

In your wp-config.php, add a new constant:

`define( 'WPDB_DRIVER', 'pdo_mysql' );`

You can specify `pdo_mysql`, `mysqli`, or `mysql`.  Any other driver will cause an error.

**Which driver is best for my site?**

They should all function equally well for WordPress.  The MySQL extension is being retired.  In PHP 5.5, using this extension issues E_DEPRECATED errors.
In PHP 5.6, it will no longer be available.  The two alternative drivers are PDO and MySQLi.  If WordPress switches to MySQLi or PDO, some cool new features
become available to developers.

**How to configure SSL?**
You can set defined in your wp-config.php to make it work. This only works for MySQLi and PDO.
These defines are: DB_SSL_KEY, DB_SSL_CERT, DB_SSL_CA, DB_SSL_CA_PATH and DB_SSL_CIPHER.

In case of a different port number then you can pass this to your database host like: 127.0.0.1:
